Node.js comes with a built-in REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment, which allows you to interactively run JavaScript code in a console-like interface. The REPL is an excellent tool for testing small code snippets, experimenting with JavaScript features, and debugging. Here are some basic commands and features of the Node.js REPL:

1. **Starting the Node.js REPL:**
To start the Node.js REPL, open your terminal or command prompt and type `node`:

```bash
node
```

After executing this command, you should see the Node.js REPL prompt, which looks like `>`. Now you can enter JavaScript code and see the results immediately.

2. **Basic Commands:**
The Node.js REPL provides a few built-in commands:

- `.help`: Display a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- `.break` (or `.b`): Exit from a multi-line expression.
- `.clear` (or `.c`): Clear the REPL context.
- `.exit` (or `.e`, `.quit`, `.q`): Exit the REPL.

3. **Running JavaScript Code:**
You can directly type and run JavaScript code in the REPL. Just enter the code and press the `Enter` key to execute it. The result will be displayed on the next line.

Example:
```javascript
> 2 + 3
5
> const message = 'Hello, World!';
undefined
> message
'Hello, World!'
```

4. **Multi-line Input:**
The REPL allows you to write multi-line expressions. If you want to write a longer piece of code that spans multiple lines, use the `.` (dot) as the last character on a line to signal the REPL that you're continuing the expression on the next line.

Example:
```javascript
> const sum = (a, b) => {
...   return a + b;
... }
undefined
> sum(5, 10)
15
```

5. **Underscore `_` Variable:**
The underscore `_` variable stores the result of the last operation. You can use it to reference the result in subsequent expressions.

Example:
```javascript
> 5 + 10
15
> _ * 2
30
```

6. **Tab Completion:**
The Node.js REPL supports tab completion, which means you can press the `Tab` key to get suggestions for available commands, variables, and functions.

Example:
```javascript
> cons
```
Press `Tab` key after typing `cons`, and it will suggest `console`.

These are some of the basic commands and features of the Node.js REPL. It's a handy tool for quick JavaScript testing and exploration. To exit the REPL, you can use the `.exit` command or press `Ctrl + C` twice (in most systems).
